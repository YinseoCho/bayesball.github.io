One represents the collection of measurements from all individuals by means of a continuous probability density \\(f(y)\\). As discussed in Chapter 5, one summarizes this probability density with the mean \\(\\mu\\): \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\mu = \\int y f(y) dy. \\end{eqnarray}\\] The value \\(\\mu\\) gives us a sense of the location of a typical value of the continuous measurement \\(Y\\). To learn about the population of measurements, a random sample of individuals \\(Y_1, ..., Y_n\\) will be taken. The general inferential problem is to use these measurements together with any prior beliefs to learn about the population mean \\(\\mu\\). In other words, the goal is to use the collected measurements to learn about a typical value of the population of measurements. 3.2 Modeling Measurements 3.2.1 Examples 3.2.1.1 College applications How many college applications does a high school senior in the United States complete? Here one imagines a population of all American high school seniors and the measurement is the number of completed college applications. The unknown quantity of interest is the mean number of applications \\(\\mu\\) completed by these high school seniors. The inferential question may be stated by asking, on average, how many college applications does an American high school senior complete. The answer to this question gives one a sense of the number of completed applications for a typical high school senior. To learn about the average \\(\\mu\\), it would be infeasible to collect this measurement from every high school senior in the U.S. Instead, a survey is typically conducted to a sample of high school seniors (ideally a sample representative of all American high school seniors) and based on the measurements from this sample, some inference is performed about the mean number of college applications. 3.2.1.2 Household spending How much does a household in San Francisco spend on housing every month? One visualizes the population of households in San Francisco and the continuous measurement is the amount of money spent on housing (either rent for renters and mortgage for homeowners) for a resident. One can ask ``on average, how much does a household spend on housing every month in San Francisco?&quot;, and the answer to this question gives one a sense of the housing costs for a typical household in San Francisco. To learn about the mean value of housing \\(\\mu\\) of all San Francisco residents, a sample survey is conducted. The mean value of the housing costs \\(\\bar y\\) from this sample of surveyed households is informative about the mean housing cost \\(\\mu\\) for all residents. 3.2.1.3 Weights of cats Suppose you have a domestic shorthair cat weighing 14 pounds and you want to find out if she is overweight. One imagines a population of all domestic shorthair cats and the continuous measurement is the weight in pounds. Suppose you were able to compute the mean weight \\(\\mu\\) of all shorthair cats. Then by comparing 14 pounds (the weight of our cat) to this mean, you would know whether your cat is overweight, or underweight, or close to the mean. If we were able to find the distribution of the weights of all domestic shorthair cats, then one observes the proportion of weights smaller than 14 pounds in the distribution and learns if the cat is severely overweight. To learn if our cat is overweight, you can ask the vet. How does the vet know? Extensive research has been conducted periodically to record weights of a large sample of domestic shorthair cats, and by using these sample of weights, the vet performs an inference about the mean \\(\\mu\\) of the weights of all domestic shorthair cats. 3.2.1.4 Comment elements of an inference problem All three examples have common elements: One has an underlying population of measurements, where the measurement is an integer, such as the number of college applications, or continuous, such as a housing cost or a cat weight. One is interested in learning about the value of the mean \\(\\mu\\) of the population of measurements. It is impossible or impractical to collect all measurements from the population, so one will collect a sample of measurements \\(Y_1, ..., Y_n\\) and use the observed measurements to learn about the unknown population mean \\(\\mu\\). 3.2.2 The general approach Recall the three general steps of Bayesian inference discussed in Chapter 7 in the context of an unknown proportion \\(p\\). Step 1: Prior We express an opinion about the location of the proportion \\(p\\) before sampling. Step 2: Data/Likelihood We take the sample and record the observed proportion. Step 3: Posterior We use Bayes’ rule to sharpen and update the previous opinion about \\(p\\) given the information from the sample. In this setting, we have a continuous population of measurements that we represent by the random variable \\(Y\\) with density function \\(f(y)\\). It is convenient to assume that this population has a Normal shape with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). That is, a single measurement \\(Y\\) is assume to come from the density function \\[\\begin{equation} f(y) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi} \\sigma} \\exp\\left\\{- \\frac{(y - \\mu)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}\\right\\}, -\\infty &lt; y&lt; \\infty. \\label{eq:normal_pdf} \\end{equation}\\] displayed in Figure . To simplify the discussion, it is convenient to assume that the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) of the measurement distribution is known. Then the objective is to learn about the single mean measurement \\(\\mu\\). Step 1 in Bayesian inference is to express an opinion about the parameter. In this continuous measurement setting, one constructs a prior for the mean parameter \\(\\mu\\) that expresses one’s opinion about the location of this mean. In this chapter, we discuss different ways to specify a prior distribution for \\(\\mu\\). One attractive discrete approach for expressing this prior opinion, similar to the approach in Chapter 7 for a proportion \\(p\\), has two steps. First one constructs a list of possible values of \\(\\mu\\), and then one assigns probabilities to the possible values to reflect one’s belief. Alternatively, we will describe the use of a continuous prior to represent one’s belief for \\(\\mu\\). This is a more realistic approach for constructing a prior since one typically views the mean as a real-valued parameter. Step 2 of our process is to collect measurements from a random sample to gain more information about the parameter \\(\\mu\\). In our first situation, one collects the number of applications from a sample of 100 high school seniors. In the second example, one collects a sample of 2000 housing costs, each from a sampled San Francisco household. The third example collects a sample of 200 different weights of domestic shorthair cats, each from a sampled cat. If these measurements are viewed as independent observations from a Normal sampling density with mean \\(\\mu\\), then one constructs a likelihood function which is the joint density of the sampled measurements viewed as a function of the unknown parameter. Once the prior is specified and measurements have been collected, one proceeds to Step 3 to use Bayes’ rule to update one’s prior opinion to obtain a posterior distribution for the mean \\(\\mu\\). The algebraic implementation of Bayes’ rule is a bit more tedious when dealing with continuous data with a Normal sampling density. But we will see there is a simple procedure for computing the posterior mean and standard deviation. 3.2.3 Outline of chapter "]
