<LI>(a)  To plot the line, you need to compute two points.  Choose two values of ABSENCES, say 5 and 10.  If ABSENSES = 5, then GRADE is equal to 102 &#151; 3.62(5) = 83.9, if ABSENSES = 10, then GRADE is equal to 102-3.62(10) = 65.8.  You plot (5, 83.9) and (10, 65.8) on graph and connect them with a line.<BR>
<BR>
(b)  If a student misses 10 classes, you predict him to get a grade of 102-3.62(10) = 65.8.<BR>
<BR>
(c)  First find the predicted grade for student B.  He missed 2 classes and the predicted grade is 102 &#151; 3.62 (2) = 94.76.  His actual grade was 82, so the residual is 82 &#151; 94.76 = -12.76.  Since this is negative, the corresponding point is below the line.<BR>
<BR>
(d)  The slope is negative, so 10 additional classes missed will result in a lower grade.  The slope -3.62 measures the change in grade for each absence, so 10 absences will result in a grade that is 10(3.62) = 36 points lower<BR>
<BR>
(e)  It would not be appropriate to predict a grade from 25 absences, since all of the absences in the dataset range from 2 to 15 &#151;-  25 is outside the range.<BR>

<LI>(a)  The proportion of students consuming a high amount of alcohol is 20/68 = .29.<BR>
<BR>
(b)  The proportion of females is 41/68 = .60.<BR>
<BR>
(c)  The proportion of male students consuming a high amount of alcohol is 8/27 = .30.<BR>
<BR>
(d)  Use a segmented bar chart (see book) to graph the low, moderate, and high percentages for men.<BR>
<BR>
(e)  To check for a relationship, look at the proportion of low, moderate, and high use for women and compare to that for men.  For example, we saw above that the proportion of males consuming a high amount is 30%.  The proportion of women consuming a high amount is 12/41 = .29 or 29%.  The proportion of high consumers is about the same for men and women, so there doesn&#146;t appear to be a relationship between consumption and gender.<BR>

<LI>(a)  You would use a random digit table by first labeling the 51 states (say with 2 digit labels 00, 01, &#133;, 50) and then choosing 10 2-digit numbers from the random digit table to get your sample.<BR>
<BR>
(b) You could sample rates from only the eastern states.  But the eastern states are likely not representative of the entire country.  A simple random sample is more likely to be representative of the USA.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Here&#146;s a simple example of parameters and statistics. Suppose I&#146;m interested in learning about the average age of cars that are driven in Ohio.  The population would be the collection of all cars driven in Ohio and the mean age for ALL cars in Ohio would be a parameter.  Suppose I take a sample of 50 cars and find out their ages &#151; the mean of these 50 ages would be a statistic.<BR>

   (c)  BGSU&#146;s final place in the MAC standings &#151; If there are six teams in the MAC &#151; east, then the place could be 1,2,3,4,5,6.  Assign probabilities to these 6 outcomes (which add up to one) which reflect your beliefs.<BR>
