studies, analyze data, discuss findings, and write explanations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

check students' progress, ask and answer questions, lead class
discussions, and deliver ``mini-lectures&quot; where appropriate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

with learning the material through reading, thinking, discussing,

<H4><A NAME="Traditional Approach"></A>The Traditional Approach
to Teaching Statistical Inference </H4>

<P CLASS="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Statistical
inference is traditionally taught using the frequentist approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>To illustrate this approach, suppose one is interested
in learning about the proportion of all undergraduate students
at a particular college who drink coffee regularly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One learns about this unknown proportion by taking a random
sample of 100 students, asking each student if they drink coffee
regularly, and computing the proportion of students who drink
coffee in the sample.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Suppose
that this sample proportion is 21/100 = .21.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Based on this data, what have we learned about the proportion
of all undergraduates who drink coffee?<o:p> </o:p> </span></P>

<P CLASS="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
frequentist approach to inference is based on the concept of a
sampling distribution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Suppose
that one is able to take samples of size 100 repeatedly from the
population of undergraduates and compute the sample proportion
for each sample selected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The collection of proportions from all of the samples is
called the sampling distribution of the proportion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The knowledge of the shape, mean, and standard deviation
of this sampling distribution is used to construct confidence
intervals for the proportion of interest, and to make decisions
about the location of the proportion.<o:p> </o:p> </span></P>

<P CLASS="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">To
correctly interpret traditional inferential procedures, students
need to understand the notion of a sampling distribution.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The students will analyze only one sample in
their data analysis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
he or she has to think what could happen if we took a large number
of random samples (like the one just selected) from the population.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, a statement such as ``95% confidence&quot; for
an interval estimate refers to the behavior of the statistical
procedure when samples are repeatedly taken from the population.<o:p>
&nbsp; </span></P>

<H4><A NAME="The Bayesian Viewpoint"></A>The Bayesian Viewpoint
</H4>

<P CLASS="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
Bayesian viewpoint toward inference is based on the subjective
interpretation of probability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In our example, the proportion of undergraduates drinking
coffee is an unknown quantity, and a probability distribution
is used to represent a person's belief about the location of this
proportion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
probability distribution, called the prior, reflects a person's
knowledge about the proportion before any data is collected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After the sample survey is taken and data are observed,
then one's opinions about the proportion will change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bayes' rule is the recipe for computing the new probability
distribution for the proportion, called the posterior, based on
knowledge of the prior probability distribution and the sample
survey data.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>All inferences about the proportion<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>are made by computing appropriate summaries
of the posterior probability distribution.<o:p> </o:p> </span></P>

<P CLASS="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">To
use Bayes' rule in an introductory statistics class, the student
needs to learn some basic probability concepts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Topics 11, 12, 13 of the text discuss the interpretation
of probabilities and methods of computing and interpreting probability
tables.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Conditional
probability is introduced in Topic 14 by means of a two-way probability
table, and this two-way table is used in Topic 15 to introduce
Bayes' rule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
basic methodology used in Topic 15 is extended to problems of
inference for<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>one proportion, one mean, and two proportions
in Topics 16, 17, 18, 19, and 21.<o:p> &nbsp; </span></P>

<H4><A NAME="Why Not"></A>Why Not Teach the Traditional Approach?
</H4>

</o:p>

<P CLASS="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Although
the traditional approach to teaching statistical inference leads
to the familiar methods used in practice, it can be difficult
to learn in a first course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The notion of a sampling distribution is perhaps the most
difficult concept, since the student is asked to think about the
variation in samples other than the one that he or she observed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If the student does not fully understand the repeated sampling
idea that is inherent in a sampling distribution, then he or she
will not be able to correctly interpret traditional inferential
conclusions like ``I am 95%<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>confident that the proportion is contained
in my interval.&quot;<o:p> </o:p> </span>&nbsp; <span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Since
the traditional inferential concepts are hard to learn, the instructor
may focus <o:p> </o:p> </span>o<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">n
teaching the mechanics of statistical inference instead of the
concepts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These mechanics
include <o:p> </o:p> the use of a variety of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>statistical recipes and the correct programming of these
recipes using a statistics computer package.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This type of ``cookbook&quot; class is counter to the modern
movement in statistics instruction which encourages more thinking
in a first class and fewer recipes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

  viewpoint provides a convenient paradigm for implementing the
  scientific method.<span style="mso-spacerun:

  to state initial beliefs about the population of interest, relevant
  sample data is collected, and the posterior probability distribution
