Minitab Local Macros for Bayesian Computation Using Minitab
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The folder 'macros' contains a collection of Minitab "local" macros --
they correspond to the "exec" macros that are described in the book
"Bayesian Computation Using Minitab".   These macros have been tested 
on recent versions of Minitab up to Release 12.

The file 'list_of_programs.txt' contains a brief description of all of the Minitab 
macros.  Sample output from the macros is contained in the 'output' folder and
a directory of the output is contained in the file 'output.html.'
